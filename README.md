# ProjectAzorian
General Graph Library for Teaching


Goals
 Support Undirected Graphs
 Suppport Directed Graphs
 
 Nodes (Store Data Optionally)
 Edges (Store Data Optionally)
    MultiEdges?

 Implement Standard Graph Algorithms

Visualize a graph (Graphics?)
    Questions on vizualizing
        Where to you put the verticies?


 Choices
    Class for all Graphs
    or 
    Class for Directed and Class for Undirected Graphs
    
    Sould Nodes and Edges be members of the Graph class
        What should be store/accessable to the Nodes and Edges of the Graph

    Should Graph Algorithms be methods of the graph class or users of the class

    path p = g.shortestpath(a,b)
    or 
    path p = shortestpath(g,a,b)
